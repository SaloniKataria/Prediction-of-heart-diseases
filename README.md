# Prediction-of-heart-diseases
I build various predictive models post data cleaning, exploration of a dataset from Kaggle. 
The various models applied to the data set were: decision trees, k-Nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. 

Result: 
      Support Vector Machine gives the maximum accuracy. 
      
      Recommendations were suggested based on the results.
